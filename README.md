## tree.js

A lightweight javascript implementation of fully linked tree structures. Each node in the tree knows its parent, its left sibling, its right sibling and its children.

For running the tests, make sure you have [node.js](http://nodejs.org) and nodeunit (`npm install nodeunit`) installed, then excecute the script `run_tests`.
